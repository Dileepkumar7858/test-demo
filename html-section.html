 <h2>-JÃ¸rgensen attempts to explain</h2>
 <p>disproportionate rates of participation along wealth and income groups as a function of fixed costs associated with investing</p><p> Her research concludes that a fixed cost of <b>$200 per year is sufficient</b> to explain why nearly half of all U.S. households do not participate in the market.</p>[16]<br> Participation rates have been shown to strongly correlate with education levels, promoting the hypothesis that information and transaction costs of market participation are better absorbed by more educated households. Behavioral economists Harrison Hong, Jeffrey Kubik and Jeremy Stein suggest that sociability and participation rates of communities have a statistically significant impact on an individual's </br><blockquote>decision to participate in the market. Their research indicates that social individuals living in states with higher than average participation rates are 5% more likely to participate than individuals that do not share those characteristics.[17] This phenomenon also explained in cost terms. Knowledge of market functioning diffuses through communities and consequently lowers transaction costs associated with investing.</blockquote>
