<p>The coffee beans are ground, also known as milling, to facilitate the brewing process.</p>

<p>The fineness of the grind If a brewing method is used in which the time of exposure of the ground coffee to the heated water is adjustable, then a short brewing time can be used for finely ground coffee. This produces coffee of equal flavor yet uses less ground coffee. A blade grinder does not cause frictional heat buildup in the ground coffee unless used to grind very large amounts as in a commercial operation. A fine grind allows the most efficient extraction but coffee ground too finely will slow down filtration or screening.</p>

<p>Ground coffee deteriorates faster than roasted beans because of the greater surface area exposed to oxygen. Many coffee drinkers grind the beans themselves immediately before brewing.

There are four methods of grinding coffee for brewing:</p> 
<ul>
<li>Burr-grinding</li>
<li>Chopping</li>
<li>Pounding</li>
<li>Roller grinding</li>
</ul>
